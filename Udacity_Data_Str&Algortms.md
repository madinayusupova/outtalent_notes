# Lesson2 
## List vs Arrays
*Python list is built as an array
*Phyton list/Array Reading O(1), inserting O(n)  since you may need to shift elements to make space for the one you're inserting, or even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space
*Python is a "higher level" programming language, so you can accomplish a task with little code
*Run time of len() - O(1)
