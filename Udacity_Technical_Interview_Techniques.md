* The path to a successful algorithm's interview involves a seven-step process, which we'll go over in further detail throughout the lesson:
    1. Clarifying the Question
           * Explain to the interviewer how you understood question. Clarify crucial moments
    2. Generating Inputs & Outputs
           * Confirm the signature of the algorithm. Ex/ Given Input - matrix, 2d array. Result Output - intiger - number of islands
    3. Generating Test Cases
           *  Thinking through tests and edge cases for inputs into the algorithm.
    4. Brainstorming
           * Interviewer is there to help you
           * Being able to take in their feedback demonstrates your teamwork skills
           * When you stuck brainstorm on data structures and algorithms 
    5. Runtime Analysis
           * Calculate runtime O()
           * This is an important step because you may realize that your solution is not optimal while analyzing run time.
    6. Coding
           * Coding after first 5 steps is easier
           * The interviewee also made sure to let the interviewer know what he was doing when he was coding.
           * Reading out loud code is annoying, focus more on explaining the purpose of the code while you write
           * By talking out loud, you give your interviewer the chance to jump in and help if your logic is wrong.
    7. Debugging
           * Show the interviewer that the candidate checks their code,
           * Help the candidate find mistakes
